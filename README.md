# QR_CUDA
###GPU implementation of QR decomposition using CGS and MGS

##### These files contains code for running Cholesky decomposition on a GPU. It was created and run in Visual Studio 2019 with the CUDA 11.0 development kit installed.

The input matrix and its dimensions get defined in the code. In the file QR_CGS.cu, the matrix is decomposed using the Classical Gram Schmidt algorithm. In the file QR_MGS, the Modified Gram Schmidt algorithm is used.
